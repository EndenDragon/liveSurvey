# liveSurvey

liveSurvey provides a way to solicit information from audiences and display their responses.  The intention is to build these into [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations, and leverage the [multiplex](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#multiplexing) functionality to bring audiences along.  

Starting with a [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) map.  

Socket.io code from the [socket.io](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) website example.
